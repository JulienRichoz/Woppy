# Woppy
Little addon for World of Warcraft, developped for a project

## Description
This addon helps you to fight the boss "Immerseus". The goal was to make an addon similar to DBM, but just for one boss. The addon is useless now because the boss is for lvl 90, and DBM is developped for every boss.
